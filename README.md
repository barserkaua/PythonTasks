Python Task #1:

I writed a program that takes 4 inputs, where each input consists of 2 numbers in the format x,y,
two-dimensional array having x rows and y columns for each input. The elements of the arrays whole numbers starting from 1 and incrementing by 1.
						
Example
						
Suppose the following 4 inputs are given to the program:
						
2,2
2,3
3,3
3,4
						
Then, the output of the program should be:
						
[[1, 2], [3, 4]]
[[1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6]]
[[1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6], [7, 8, 9]]
[[1, 2, 3, 4], [5, 6, 7, 8], [9, 10, 11, 12]]


Python Task #2:

Program that  accept a sequence of comma-separated transaction passwords and will check them according to the criteria. Passwords that match the criteria
each separated by a comma.

The following are the criteria for checking the transaction password:

1. At least 1 letter between [a-z]
2. At least 1 number between [0-9]
3. At least 1 letter between [A-Z]
4. At least 1 character from [*#+@]
5. Minimum length of transaction password: 4
6. Maximum length of transaction password: 6
7. No space is allowed


Example

If the following passwords are given as input to the program:

Abc@1,a B1#,2w3E*,2We#3345

Then, the output of the program should be:

Abc@1,2w3E*
